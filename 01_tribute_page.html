                <h2>About "Netaji"</h2>
                <p><b>Subhas Chandra Bose</b> was born on 23 january 1897 in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British
                    Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take
                    the Indian Civil Service examination. He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but
                    demurred at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to
                    India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National
                    Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to leadership in a group within the Congress which was less
                    keen on constitutional reform and more open to socialism. Bose became Congress president in 1938.
                    After reelection in 1939, differences arose between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi,
                    over the future federation of British India and princely states, but also because discomfort had
                    grown among the Congress leadership over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans
                    for greater powers for himself. After the large majority of the Congress Working Committee
                    members resigned in protest, Bose resigned as president and was eventually ousted from the
                    party.</p>
